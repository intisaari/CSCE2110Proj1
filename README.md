Project Description: The purpose of this project is to stimulate the growth of a city over time. This project simulates the growth of residential, commercial, and industrial zones, and looks at how pollution impacts the overall development of these zones. These zones (commerical, residential, and industrial) are represented by a 2 dimensional array, also checked to see if they meet the requirements for being populated over time.

Additional Project Information: I have completed this project within my UNT course in Computing Foundations II with my group members.
